## <u>Alignment and Shape</u> of a Normal Spine
The spine consists of 33 bones connected by ligaments, joints, and discs to form a column, surrounded by thick muscles that control its movement. There are 7 **cervical vertebrae (neck bones)**, 12 **thoracic vertebrae (upper back)**, and 5 **lumbar vertebrae (lower back)**. The remaining 8 bones (**sacrum and coccyx**) are fused together, connecting to the pelvis and functioning as the tailbone.

When the spine is **viewed from the front or back**, it should appear straight in the center. However, when **viewed from the side**, it exhibits an S-shaped curve. The cervical and lumbar regions naturally curve forward (**lordosis**), while the thoracic and sacral regions curve backward (**kyphosis**). Just as every person's face is unique, the degree of lordosis and kyphosis varies from individual to individual.

##### **Understanding Spinal Structures for Radiographic Interpretation**
To assess spinal deformity via radiography, it is necessary to understand the spinal structures. The anterior vertebral body is connected to the posterior elements—such as the lamina, transverse processes, and spinous processes—by a structure called the **pedicle**. In X-rays, <u>the position of the pedicles acts as a crucial reference for determining rotational deformity of the spine; the severity of this rotation is judged based on their location.</u>

## Deformed Shape in Scoliosis
<u>Scoliosis refers to a deformity where the spine, which should appear straight when viewed from the front or back, curves sideways into a "C" or "S" shape (<b>lateral curvature</b>).</u> Since it can present symptoms such as leaning to one side or asymmetry in shoulder height and waistline curves, <u>it must be carefully distinguished from issues caused simply by poor posture.</u>

According to the definition established by the **Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)** in 1986, scoliosis is defined as a <u>lateral curvature of 11 degrees or more</u>. Here, 11 degrees refers to the angle formed by lines drawn along the upper and lower surfaces of the most tilted vertebrae in the curved spine on an X-ray (lines 1 and 2 in the diagram above). This angle, which indicates the magnitude of scoliosis, is called the scoliosis angle or **<u>Cobb angle</u>**.

A **normal, straight spine** has a Cobb angle of 0 degrees. A curvature between 1 and 10 degrees is considered **postural asymmetry** rather than true scoliosis.
