Hello.

I am spinemaster, and I am writing to welcome you to my new blog. I chose the nickname "spinemaster" because I have specialized in spine surgery for over 35 years. Even now, I remain as active in the operating room as any younger surgeon, so I believe I can use this title without hesitation.

For about 30 years, I served as a spine specialist at one of Korea’s top four major hospitals. Throughout my career, I have focused exclusively on spine surgery, particularly specializing in spinal deformities, spinal tumors, and high-complexity surgical cases.

I remain deeply involved in both surgical and academic activities regarding spinal deformities—specifically pediatric and adult spinal deformities—and have authored numerous chapters in spinal surgery textbooks. I had originally prepared materials to publish a book for the general public; however, realizing that most people today seek information via social media or online platforms rather than physical books, I decided to share this content through a blog instead. I warmly welcome all patients and visitors interested in this field.

As this is my first time running a blog, the formatting may be a bit rough. I ask for your understanding, and I promise to compensate for any lack of style with high-quality, substantial content.

Some posts may contain in-depth material suitable for medical residents. However, because many patients and guardians desire detailed knowledge, I also intend to share professional, up-to-date medical opinions to satisfy that curiosity.

We live in an era of information overload, where the general public can easily access a vast amount of medical information to check their health and manage diseases. However, this flood of information can often confuse patients regarding what is right and wrong. As a spine specialist who has treated patients for over 30 years, I have often felt that while some patients possess surprisingly advanced information, they can also be unexpectedly uninformed about the basics.

Where does the truth end and overreaction begin? Parents often worry excessively, and the media tends to exaggerate certain issues. Consequently, unverified treatments run rampant in this field. You might hear from "reputable" media sources that scoliosis is caused by bad posture, or that school desks and chairs are too small for growing children. Riding this wave of misinformation, some parties claim that gymnastics, acupuncture, or electrical stimulation are effective cures, while some doctors advocate for spinal manipulation.

Furthermore, many clinics claim to treat scoliosis, including physical therapists and practitioners of traditional medicine. Even among orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons, there are not many specialists who have deeply studied and researched scoliosis. Therefore, it is difficult for the general public to judge which hospital offers the safest care or which treatment is truly effective. Media reports are not always accurate; exaggerated or incorrect articles frequently appear even in major outlets.

Therefore, I felt it was my calling as a spine specialist to provide accurate information through writing. My goal is to relieve patients' vague anxieties about scoliosis and help them distinguish the truth—separating the wheat from the chaff—amidst a sea of misinformation.
