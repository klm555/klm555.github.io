One of the most common misconceptions among the general public is that scoliosis is simply a condition where the spine curves sideways.

While the term "scoliosis" itself refers to a one-dimensional deformity where the normal spinal curve bends <u>sideways</u> (**lateral curvature**), structural scoliosis is actually a **3D deformity**. This involves **<u>axial rotation</u>** of the vertebral bodies in the cross-section and a **loss of normal thoracic kyphosis** when viewed from the side. In other words, it is a form of **spinal twisting** around a straight axis.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/척추의 꼬임.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 mx-auto d-block"
        zoomable=true width="50%" %}

Scoliosis is a **three-dimensional deformity** that accompanies not only the sideways bending (**lateral curvature**) but also **rotational deformity** of the vertebral bodies in the cross-section. This leads to deformation of the ribs and rib cage, as well as the loss of the normal backward curve (kyphosis) of the upper back when viewed from the side, resulting in a flattened or depressed appearance (**lordotic deformity**).

The best way to visualize this three-dimensional deformity at a glance is through **CT cross-sectional images**, as shown below.

        zoomable=true width="30%" %}
    </div>

    A cross-sectional view of the 3D deformity in scoliosis looks like this. In the chest cross-section, the spine is rotated (<b>rotational deformity</b>), shifted to one side (<b>lateral deviation</b>), and appears to penetrate into the chest cavity (<b>loss of kyphosis</b>). You can see the asymmetry of both lungs, with the left lung looking almost compressed. Also, one side of the back of the rib cage protrudes, caused by the rotation of the vertebral bodies. <b>a: Vertebral rotation angle, b: Vertebral lateral deviation, c: Rib cage rotation angle</b>.
