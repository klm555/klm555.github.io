As a spine surgeon with approximately 35 years of experience, I have dedicated my career to the surgical treatment and academic research of spinal deformities in both children and adults. I remain actively engaged in clinical practice and research to this day.

Through my posts here, I aim to correct the widespread misinformation regarding scoliosis found online and provide visitors with accurate, medically proven facts.

본인은 약 35년간 척추수술을 해온 척추외과 전문의로서, 특히 소아 척추변형과 성인 척추변형에 관한 수술과 학술활동에 매진해 왔으며, 현재도 현역에서 활발히 이를 이어가고 있습니다.  
이 공간을 통해 인터넷상에 무분별하게 퍼져 있는 척추측만증에 관한 정보를 올바르게 정리하여, 정확한 의학적 사실을 전달하고자 합니다.
